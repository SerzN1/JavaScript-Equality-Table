# JavaScript equality comparison

Don't break your head, use `===` comparison!

JavaScript equality comparison is a crazy thing, sometimes.
When in doubt, use three equals signs.

You can view the demo [here](http://serzn1.github.io/JavaScript-Equality-Table/).

## How it works

The goal here is to get a string that evaluates to the desired
value. This string is set to object.asString

For complicated cases which can't be passed in JSON the value
can be passed as a string wrapped in backticks which is evaluated
here.
example: "`parseFloat("nan")`" means NaN.
